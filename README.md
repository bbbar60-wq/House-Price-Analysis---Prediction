# House Price Analysis & Prediction

This is a comprehensive data science project focused on analyzing and predicting house prices using the popular Ames Housing dataset. The project walks through the entire machine learning workflow, from data exploration and cleaning to feature engineering and model building.

## üìú Project Description

Predicting house prices is a classic regression problem in data science. This project tackles it by employing various data analysis and machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the final sale price of a house based on its features (e.g., size, number of rooms, location, condition). The project emphasizes understanding the data through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preparing it for modeling through rigorous feature engineering.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis of the dataset to understand feature distributions, identify correlations with the sale price, and detect outliers.
-   **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values using various imputation strategies (e.g., mean, median, mode, or more sophisticated methods).
-   **Feature Engineering**:
    -   Transforms skewed numerical features using transformations like the logarithm.
    -   Converts categorical features into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
    -   Creates new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
-   **Model Building**: Implements and evaluates several regression models, including:
    -   Linear Regression
    -   Ridge Regression
    -   Lasso Regression
    -   Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
-   **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on a held-out test set.
-   **Visualization**: Uses libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful plots and graphs throughout the analysis.

## üìÇ Project Workflow

The notebook is structured to follow a logical data science pipeline:

1.  **Data Loading & Initial Exploration**: Load the datasets and get a first look at the features and their types.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Dive deep into the target variable (`SalePrice`) and its relationship with other important features.
3.  **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Handle missing data, correct data types, and remove outliers.
4.  **Feature Engineering**: Transform and create new features to prepare the data for modeling.
5.  **Modeling**: Train various regression models on the processed data.
6.  **Evaluation**: Compare the models' performance and select the best one.
7.  **Prediction**: Use the final model to make predictions on the test dataset.
